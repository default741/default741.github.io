I am a **machine learning engineer** and **researcher** with a strong foundation in computer science, deep learning, and **quantum computing**. Currently, I am pursuing MS in Computer Science at [***George Washington University***](https://www.gwu.edu/), where I also serve as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant**, mentoring students in Python, Java, and Software Engineering.

Previously, I worked as a Senior ML Engineer and Data Scientist at [***Thoucentric (A Xoriant Company)***](https://thoucentric.com/), where I built and optimized machine learning models, developed data pipelines, and deployed real-time forecasting solutions. I have worked on projects involving defect detection, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics, achieving significant efficiency improvements and cost reductions. Additionally, my research in quantum computing includes developing **quantum-RAM** implementations and exploring **graph coloring using quantum circuits**.

I am proficient in **Python**, **Java**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Qiskit**, and cloud platforms like **Azure** and **GCP**. Passionate about AI, quantum machine learning, and software engineering, I continuously explore innovative solutions to complex computational problems, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications.
